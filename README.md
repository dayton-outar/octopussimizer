# Octopussimizer

Crawling through a web site to find all its pages and feel through each page with the tentacles of an octopus to perform page optimization by decreasing file size where necessary and making use of minifying and bundling tools.

## Requirements

So, the main idea for optimizing a page or, better yet, a web site is to,

 * Remove unused (or irrelevant) styles from the stylesheets linked by each page in order to decrease file size
 * Minify JavaScript (JS) files by removing as much white space as possible in order to decrease file size
 * Bundle CSS and JS files into one file each respectively so as to decrease roundtrips to the server

All the above should be in the core library of the software.

The -o parameter lets you specify the output directory (which will get created in case it doesnâ€™t exist). Once that command finishes, navigate into the folder and then execute the following commands:

```bash
dotnet new sln -o Harpoon
```

```bash
dotnet new classlib -o api/O8Query
```

```bash
dotnet new webapi -o api/Harpoon
```

```bash
dotnet sln Harpoon.sln add api/Harpoon/Harpoon.csproj api/O8Query/O8Query.csproj
```

```bash
dotnet build O8Query/O8Query.csproj
```

```bash
dotnet run -p api/Harpoon.csproj
```

```bash
dotnet publish api/Harpoon.csproj -o ../build -c Release
```
