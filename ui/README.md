Had some issue installing a package to integrate vue with graphql and [this reference](https://www.gitmemory.com/issue/vuejs/vue-apollo/1156/821996642) really helped by giving me the following command,

```bash
npm install @vue/apollo-composable --save --legacy-peer-deps
```
### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
